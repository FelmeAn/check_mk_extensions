description:
 The {STONESOFT-NETNODE-MIB} is a vendor specific MIB.
 This check uses that MIB in order to monitor the
 current CPU utilization of the target host. Please note, that - unlike
 check based on the check_mk_agent, the percentage does not reflect
 the usage during the complete check interval but is just a snapshot
 of the current usage.

inventory:
 One check is automatically created if at least one CPU
 entry is found in the SNMP output.
